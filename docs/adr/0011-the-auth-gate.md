# The auth gate

Identity is **Better Auth** (`worker/auth.ts`): email + password signup, sessions in D1. Signup has
**three states**, all decided server-side on `/sign-up/email` (hiding UI wouldn't stop a direct POST):

- **CLOSED** — `INVITE_CODES` unset/empty and no per-email invite matches: nobody can create an
  account. Fail-closed default.
- **INVITE** (alpha default) — a `hooks.before` accepts the request only if its `inviteCode` is a
  valid per-email single-use invite (#251) or is in the comma-separated `INVITE_CODES` secret. The
  public `POST /api/waitlist` (per-IP rate-limited, D1 `waitlist` table) collects emails from people
  who want one.
- **OPEN** (#293) — `SIGNUP_OPEN === "true"` (fail-closed: only that exact literal opens it; the
  pure gate is `isSignupOpen` in `worker/identity.ts`) skips the invite requirement. Signup is then
  gated by **Cloudflare Turnstile** instead of a code. `SIGNUP_OPEN` ships **unset** — opening
  signup is a deliberate runbook flip, not a deploy side effect. `INVITE_CODES` and per-email
  invites stay working as permanent backdoors regardless of state.

**Turnstile** (#293) is Better Auth's `captcha` plugin, provider `cloudflare-turnstile`, registered
**only when `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is set** (the optional-secrets pattern — no key = no plugin =
signup/reset behave exactly as before; local dev and forks unaffected). It gates **exactly**
`/sign-up/email` and `/request-password-reset` (the client's real reset endpoint; `/forget-password`
is its legacy alias) — deliberately **NOT sign-in**, which must stay token-free so the MCP OAuth
resume path keeps working and Better Auth's own rate limiting carries the brute-force load. The
client sends the solved token in the `x-captcha-response` header (the plugin's `onRequest` reads
exactly that, fails closed on missing/invalid). The SPA learns the mode + PUBLIC site key from the
dumb, session-free **`GET /api/auth-config`** (`{signupOpen, turnstileSiteKey}`) and renders the
widget (`src/components/turnstile.tsx`, a hand-rolled wrapper over Cloudflare's script — no
dependency) only when a key is present, so no-key = no-widget matches plugin-unregistered parity.

Better Auth's `user` table IS the global identity store and `user.id` is the stable, permanent key
the Worker routes each user's outline Durable Object by. The Worker builds auth **per request**
(`createAuth(env)`) because the D1 binding only exists inside `fetch` — it cannot be a module
singleton.

**The shell is public; only the data API is gated.** The Worker serves the static SPA (so the login
screen can load) and `/api/auth/*` (Better Auth's own handler) without a session; `/api/nodes` and
`/api/kv` require a valid session (`auth.api.getSession`) and 401 otherwise. The client gates the
editor behind `useSession()` (root `AuthGate`) and shows the login screen when signed out. This
**replaced** the old three-tier `authorize()` (Cloudflare Access + localhost + HTTP Basic Auth, in
`git log`): Access can't do public self-serve signup, which a multi-tenant product needs.

**Owner-continuity bridge.** The pre-auth outline lives in the constant `'default'` DO (seeded from
legacy D1). Setting the `OWNER_USER_ID` secret to the owner's `user.id` maps that one account back
to `'default'`, carrying their existing data over with **zero copy** — everyone else routes to their
own `user.id` DO. `ensureSeeded` (the legacy D1 import) therefore runs only for the `'default'` DO;
new users start empty. Removable once that data is wherever it belongs.

**Google sign-in (sign-IN only, explicit linking).** `socialProviders.google` is registered when the
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` secrets exist, with **`disableSignUp: true`** — the OAuth
face of the invite gate. It must be `disableSignUp` (hard), not `disableImplicitSignUp`, which a
client-supplied `requestSignUp: true` waives — that would be an invite bypass. A Google identity
with no account gets `?error=signup_disabled` back on the AuthScreen. **Linking an existing
email+password account to Google:** the EXPLICIT path (`linkSocial` behind the More menu's "Connect
Google", while signed in) always works. IMPLICIT linking on a signed-out Google sign-in stays at
Better Auth's default, which refuses when the local email is **unverified** — because an attacker who
pre-registered the victim's address could otherwise capture the victim's Google identity into an
attacker-owned account. **Now that verification is ON (#293), a VERIFIED account's signed-out Google
sign-in links implicitly** — the gate lifts for exactly the accounts we can trust, with **zero code
change** (verified from the Better Auth source, `oauth2/link-account.mjs`: the refusal is
`(!trustedProvider && !googleEmailVerified) || (requireLocalEmailVerified && !localEmailVerified) ||
…`; `requireLocalEmailVerified` defaults `true`, `trustedProviders: ["google"]` clears the first
clause, and a `true` local `emailVerified` clears the second, so both fail and linking proceeds).
Existing accounts are grandfathered verified (migration 0008), so this works for them from day one; a
still-unverified brand-new signup stays refused until it confirms. Don't reach for
`requireLocalEmailVerified: false`: deprecated upstream, and the gate becomes unconditional next
minor. `allowDifferentEmails: true` loosens only the authenticated explicit-link path (the session
proves ownership); the signed-out lookup is email-keyed, so a different-address Google sign-in
finds no account and hits the signup gate. Linking preserves `user.id`, so the outline DO routing
never changes. The whole flow is navigation-based (redirects, fresh page loads), which satisfies
the hardReset teardown rule by construction; on an MCP OAuth hop the AuthScreen passes
`/api/auth/mcp/authorize?<query>` as the `callbackURL`, so the Google callback itself resumes the
authorize flow top-level.

**node:crypto** — Better Auth needs it, so wrangler sets `compatibility_flags: ["nodejs_compat"]`.

**Transactional email** is wired (map #151 / #169): Cloudflare Email Service via the Workers
`send_email` binding, every sender funneled through the one `worker/email.ts` seam (the
provider-swap point; Resend is the named fallback). Password reset works: `sendResetPassword`
rides `ctx.waitUntil` (uniform response timing — no enumeration side channel — and the isolate
outlives the response) with `revokeSessionsOnPasswordReset: true`; the public `/reset-password`
route renders OUTSIDE the root AuthGate. **`requireEmailVerification` is now ON (#293)**: with signup
able to open to the public, an unverified address is a real hole (anyone could sign up as anyone), so
an account can't create a session until it confirms its email. `emailVerification.sendVerificationEmail`
rides the same `ctx.waitUntil` + `worker/email.ts` seam as the reset mail (same isolate-lifetime and
timing reasoning). **Existing alpha accounts are grandfathered verified** by a one-time
`UPDATE "user" SET emailVerified = 1` (migration 0008) so none is locked out on deploy; new signups
verify through the emailed link. `bun run seed:user` flips the local dev account verified directly in
D1 (no inbox to click) so it stays immediately sign-in-able. Turning verification on is also what
makes implicit Google linking start working for verified accounts (see above).

**Don't:** key the DO off the email (permanent-name orphaning — use `user.id`); make `createAuth` a
module singleton (the D1 binding is request-scoped); gate the static shell (the login screen must
load); or relax the `/api/*` session check to trust a client-supplied id.
